## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michael. I have been building websites for almost 2/3 of my life and it hasn't become boring (yet). However, even more than working on websites, I enjoy helping others. That's why I built stuff like [miyagi](https://www.miyagi.dev) and lead an amazing team of frontend developers at [Factorial](https://www.factorial.io).

I (very irregular) put some notes on [my website](https://www.mgrossklaus.de) where I also list some of [my work](https://www.mgrossklaus.de/work).

Oh, and if you are like me into hi-fi â€” or you simply appreciate if your music sounds as good as it can get â€” you might want to check out [HiFi Log](https://www.hifilog.com). A platform that I built to combine my two hobbies: Music and web development.

Thanks for hanging around!
